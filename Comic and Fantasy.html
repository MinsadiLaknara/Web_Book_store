<center><h2>Histroy of Comic and Fantasy books </h2>
	<h3>Fantasy comics have been around as long as the medium itself. The classification "fantasy comics" broadly encompasses 
	illustrated books set in an other-worldly universe or involving elements or actors completely outside the realm of our reality.
	Fantasy has been a mainstay of fiction or centuries, but the resurgence of fantasy in fiction around the late 1930s and early 1940s, spurred by authors such as C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien likely
	inspired comic book producers who were experiencing an explosion of interest at the time. </h3>
	<br>
	<h3>Fantasy-themed books—driven by superhero comics gaining popularity through the 60s—grew to dominate the field. In the 90s, fantasy authors such as 
	Neil Gaiman helped expand the fantasy comics genre to even greater heights with the critically acclaimed Sandman series..</h3>

	 <h3><b><u> Kevin Eastman</u> </b></h3><br><br>
	<h3>Eastman was born in Portland, Maine. He attended Westbrook High School in Westbrook, Maine, with comic book illustrator Steve Lavigne.
	Kevin was "raised in a Christian family", and grew up a comic book fan, with Jack Kirby as his idol and Kamandi as his favorite title of his.
In 1983 he worked in a restaurant while he searched for publishers for his comics. He met a waitress who was attending the University of Massachusetts 
Amherst and followed her to Northampton, Massachusetts. While searching for a local underground newspaper to publish his work, he began a professional relationship with Peter Laird, who worked at nearby Dover,
 New Hampshire, and the two collaborated for a short time on various comics projects.</h3><br>
 <h3>In May 1984, Eastman and Laird self-published the first black & white issue of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
 The forty-page oversized comic had an initial print run of 3,275 copies and was largely funded by a US$1000 loan from Eastman's uncle Quentin.
 It was published by the duo's Mirage Studios, a name chosen because, as Eastman says, "there wasn't an actual studio, only kitchen tables and couches with lap boards."
 By September 1985, their first issue had received three additional printings.</h3>

	graphic novels, nonfiction, audio theatre, and films. 
	His works include the comic book series The Sandman and novels Stardust, American Gods, Coraline, and The Graveyard Book.</h3>
	<br><h3>He has won numerous awards, including the Hugo, Nebula, and Bram Stoker awards, as well as the Newbery and Carnegie medals. 
	He is the first author to win both the Newbery and the Carnegie medals for the same work, The Graveyard Book (2008).
	In 2013, The Ocean at the End of the Lane was voted Book of the Year in the British National Book Awards</h3>

<h3><b><u>Paulo Coelho</u> </b></h3><br><br>
	<h3>In 1982, Coelho published his first book, Hell Archives, which failed to make a substantial impact.
	In 1986 he contributed to the Practical Manual of Vampirism, although he later tried to take it off the shelves since he considered it "of bad quality."
	After making the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in 1986, Coelho wrote The Pilgrimage, published in 1987. The following year, Coelho wrote The Alchemist and published it through 
	a small Brazilian publishing house that made an initial print run of 900 copies and decided not to reprint it. He subsequently found a bigger publishing house, and with the publication of his next book Brida, 
	The Alchemist took off. HarperCollins decided to publish the book in 1994. Later it became an international bestseller. </h3>
	<br><h3>In 2016, he was contacted by basketball player Kobe Bryant, who wanted to discuss a children's book project with him.
	Some months before Bryant's death in a helicopter crash in January 2020, they started to write the book together, but upon hearing about his passing, Coelho decided to delete the whole draft.
	And in 2018, it was announced that Coelho had signed for a 
	TV series based on the characters of his novels The Devil and Miss Prym, Brida and The Witch of Portobello.</h3>
