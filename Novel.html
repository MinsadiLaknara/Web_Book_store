<center><h2>Histroy of Novel books </h2>
	<h3>A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, normally written in prose form,
	and which is typically published as a book. The present English word for a long work of prose fiction derives
	from the Italian novella for "new", "news", or "short story of something new", itself from the Latin novella,
	a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning "new".
Some novelists, including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Ann Radcliffe, John Cowper Powys, preferred the term "romance" to describe their novels.</h3>
