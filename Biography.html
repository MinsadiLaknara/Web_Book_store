<center><h2>Histroy of Biography books </h2>
	<h3>A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education,
	work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), 
	a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience,
	and may include an analysis of the subject's personality..</h3>

   <h3><b><u>James Baldwin</u> </b></h3><br><br>
	<h3>James Arthur Baldwin (August 2, 1924 – December 1, 1987) was an American novelist, playwright, essayist, poet, and activist.
	His essays, as collected in Notes of a Native Son (1955), explore intricacies of racial, sexual, and class distinctions in Western society, 
	most notably in regard to the mid-twentieth-century United States. Some of Baldwin's essays are book-length,
	including The Fire Next Time (1963), No Name in the Street (1972), and The Devil Finds Work (1976).</h3>
	<br><h3>Baldwin's novels, short stories, and plays fictionalize fundamental personal questions and dilemmas amid complex social and psychological pressures.
	Themes of masculinity, sexuality, race, and class intertwine to create intricate narratives that run parallel with some of the major political movements toward social change in mid-twentieth-century America,
	such as the Civil Rights Movement and the Gay Liberation Movement. As such, Baldwin's protagonists are often, but not exclusively,</h3>

  <h3><b><u> Oliver Stone</u> </b></h3><br><br>
	<h3>William Oliver Stone (born September 15, 1946) is an American film director, producer, and writer.
Stone won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay as writer of Midnight Express (1978), and wrote the gangster movie Scarface (1983).
 Stone achieved prominence as writer and director of the war drama Platoon (1986), which won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture. 
 Platoon was the first in a trilogy of films based on the Vietnam War, in which Stone served as an infantry soldier.
 He continued the series with Born on the Fourth of July (1989)—for which Stone won his second Best Director Oscar—and Heaven & Earth (1993). </h3>
 <br><h3>Many of Stone's films focus on controversial American political issues during the late 20th century, and as such were considered contentious at the times of their releases. They often combine different camera and film formats within a single scene, as demonstrated in JFK (1991), Natural Born Killers (1994), and Nixon (1995).[4]

Like his subject matter, Stone has become a controversial figure in American filmmaking, 
with critics accusing him of promoting unsubstantiated conspiracy theories, and of misrepresenting real-world events and figures in his works</h3>
